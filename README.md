# kde-config
Optimal configuration files for the KDE Desktop Environment

## Tiling
+ Install `Krohnkite` though the KWin Scripts section of the System Settings
+ Run the following commend to get access to changing Krohnkite's settings in the KWin Scripts settings:

```
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/kservices5/
ln -s ~/.local/share/kwin/scripts/krohnkite/metadata.desktop ~/.local/share/kservices5/krohnkite.desktop
```

+ Enable Krohnkite and access its settings
  + In `Layout` deselect every layout except `Tile Layout`
  + Add a desired gap in `Geometry` (I like 15 for normal DPI displays)
  + In `Behaviour` select `Directional` in the `Directional Keys Behaviours` area
  + In `Options` select `Remove borders of tiled windows`
  + Apply changes
+ In `System Settings`, under `Window Behaviour`, change the `Window activation policy` to `Focus follows mouse` and set `Delay focus` to `0ms`

## Shortcuts
Designed to emulate popular tiling window managers
+ Ensure there are 10 virtual desktops in kde

## Latte Layout
Beautiful macOS esque layout with a "get out of my way when I don't need you" design philosophy

+ Left:
  + Application Dashboard
  + [Virtual Desktop Bar](https://github.com/wsdfhjxc/virtual-desktop-bar)

  + System Tray
  + Window Buttons
